        <p>My name is <em>Jade Menson</em> , I'm 19 years old. I have loved art and technology since I was a kid. I did art and
            some IT all
            through high school. I'm currently in college at Algonquin College, studying Interactive Media Design. This is my first post secondary education and I'm very
            excited about it. </p>

    <p> Family is one of the most important things to me. I appreciate my family because they push me to be my best and
        support me unconditionally. Some of my hobbies include; sketching, painting, listening to muisc and sleeping. In
        a few years I would like to graduate from Algonquin with top-notch skills and knowledge to be able to do well in
        any interactive media design field. </p>
